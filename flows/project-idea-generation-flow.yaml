# The prompt for the AI model to synthesize the project idea
prompt: |
  Based on the following user inputs, generate a list of potential project ideas:
  - Industry: {industry}
  - Technology preference: {technology_preference}
  - Project scale: {project_scale}
  - Objective: {objective}
  - Deadline: {deadline}
  For each idea, include the following:
  - Brief description of the idea
  - The required resources and team members
  - Project scale (solo/team)
  - Expected impact (e.g., technological, social, environmental)
  - Relevant technologies, based on user inputs
  - Consider the prize sponsor like {prize_sponsors} and how it could influence the choice of technology stack.

# ReadMe configuration
readme: |
  This flow is designed to help users generate innovative project ideas based on specific inputs, such as industry, technology stack, project scale, and objective.
  
  ### Workflow Overview:
  1. **User Input Collection**: Collects user inputs regarding industry, technology, project scale, and objectives.
  2. **Idea Synthesis**: Synthesizes project ideas based on the user inputs to generate detailed project ideas, including project scope, resources, and expected impact.
  
  ### Inputs:
  - **Industry**: The sector or industry for the project idea.
  - **Technology Preference**: The technology stack the user prefers to work with.
  - **Project Scale**: The scope of the project (solo, team, large-scale).
  - **Objective**: The main goal or purpose of the project (e.g., problem-solving, innovation).
  - **Deadline**: Timeframe for completing the project.
  - **Prize Sponsors**: Optional, a sponsor or technology to be considered.

  ### Outputs:
  - A list of project ideas, including:
    - A brief description
    - Resources required
    - Scope (solo/team)
    - Expected impact
    - Relevant technologies
